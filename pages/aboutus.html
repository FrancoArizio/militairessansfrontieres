            Militaires Sans Frontières (\mi.li.tɛʁ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃.tjɛʁ\ mee-lee-TEH son fron-TEER), abbreviated MSF and known
            in English as Army Without Borders, was a private military company founded and led by renowned mercenary Big
            Boss in the early 1970s. Abandoning their home countries, the "soldiers without borders" provided their
            services to all clients, regardless of nation or ideology, operating from their offshore Mother Base in the

            fʁɔ̃.tjɛʁ\ mee-lee-TEH son fron-TEER), abbreviated MSF and known in English as Army Without Borders, was a
            private military company founded and led by renowned mercenary Big Boss in the early 1970s. Abandoning their
            home countries, the "soldiers without borders" provided their services to all clients, regardless of nation
            or ideology, operating from their offshore Mother Base in the Caribbean Sea, of which the group itself is
            called by that name.
            After leaving the Patriots in 1972, Naked Snake, a.k.a. Big Boss, formed the Militaires Sans Frontières to
            provide military force to anyone who needed it, regardless of nation or ideology. As such, the MSF
            specialized in providing a full range of military services, including combat, logistics, training, weapons,
            outfitting, and R&D. In addition, the MSF was designed to merge the small footprint and exceptional
            performance of special forces groups with the full military might of a full regular army, as a means to
            fully break free of nation-states. To avoid enemy intelligence services like the CIA, MSF did not initially
            establish a permanent base, often choosing to relocate their forces as required.

            Employed by the Colombian government sometime after 1972, Snake and the MSF fought an opposing mercenary
            unit led by Kazuhira Miller for their last contracted job. After MSF defeated the enemy force, Snake offered
            Miller a place in the group, which he eventually accepted, later becoming its second-in-command. During this
            time, Miller viewed MSF as a new business model for private military contractors, neither acting as typical
            mercenaries nor a foreign legion, and intended to help the organization expand.</p>
