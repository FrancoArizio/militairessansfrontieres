                <p class="rescue_text">Hostage situations are defined as events whereby the actor (i.e., the hostage
                    taker) are holding one of more persons captive against their will. The motives for these attacks can
                    be diverse, and vary from expressive motives such as voicing an opinion or religious view to
                    instrumental motives such as for financial gain through ransom demands (Alexander and Klein, 2009).
                    There are a number of possibilities for communication and the use of social media during hostage
                    situations with the victims, hostage takers, LEAs, media outlets and public bystanders all
                    possessing
                    the potential to comment and monitor the situation before, during, and after the event itself.</p>

                <p class="rescue_text">Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people who need help. It
                    is
                    usually short-term help until the long-term help by the government and other institutions replaces
                    it.
                    Among the people in need are the homeless, refugees, and victims of natural disasters, wars, and
                    famines. Humanitarian relief efforts are provided for humanitarian purposes and include natural
                    disasters and man-made disasters. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives,
                    alleviate
                    suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may, therefore, be distinguished from development aid,
                    which
                    seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.

                    Military Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR). As the military has a presence in these
                    countries lending a helping hand, it shows a softer side of the U.S. military that many countries
                    have

                <p class="rescue_text">Mountain rescue refers to search and rescue activities that occur in a
                    mountainous
                    environment, although the term is sometimes also used to apply to search and rescue in other
                    wilderness
                    environments. This tends to include mountains with technical rope access issues, snow, avalanches,
                    ice,
                    crevasses, glaciers, alpine environments and high altitudes. The difficult and remote nature of the
                    terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs has resulted in the development of a number of
                    specific
                    pieces of equipment and techniques. Helicopters are often used to quickly extract casualties, and
                    search
                    dogs may be deployed to find a casualty.</p>

                <p class="rescue_text">Search and rescue (SAR) is the search for and provision of aid to people who are
                    in
                    distress or imminent danger. The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty
                    sub-fields,
                    typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain
                    rescue;
                    ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs; urban search and rescue in
                    cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water.</p>
