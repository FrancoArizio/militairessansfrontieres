            <h2 class="course_title">Basic Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">Initial military training is an intensive residential programme commonly lasting
                several weeks or months, which aims to induct newly recruited military personnel into the social norms
                and essential tasks of the armed forces. Common features include foot drill, inspections, physical
                training, weapons training, and a graduation parade.

                The training process resocializes recruits to the demands made of them by military life. Psychological
                conditioning techniques are used to shape attitudes and behaviours, so that recruits will obey all
                orders, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle. According to an expert in
                United States military training methods, Dave Grossman, recruit training makes extensive use of four
                types of conditioning techniques: role modeling, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and
                brutalization.

                Inductees are required to partially submerge their individuality for the sake of their military unit,
                which enhances obedience to orders to perform actions normally absent from civilian life, including
                killing and prolonged exposure to danger.</p>

            <h2 class="course_title">Operator Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">An assault course (also called trim trail) is a trail (or course) that combines
                running and exercising. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.[original research?] It is often
                used in military training. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses of the individual or the
                team involved.[original research?] The term Assault Course is sometimes replaced by Obstacle Course,
                which some view as more accurate. Confidence Courses is another term used. There are also specific Urban
                Obstacle Courses and Night Obstacles Courses. An Obstacle Course Race (OCR) is a civilian sporting and
                fitness challenge event which combines obstacles and cross country running.</p>

            <h2 class="course_title">CQB Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">Close-quarters combat (CQC) or close-quarters battle (CQB) is a tactical situation
                that involves a physical fight with firearms involved between multiple combatants at quite short
                range. It can occur between military units, police/corrections officers and criminal elements, and in
                other similar situations. In warfare, it usually consists of units or teams of varying size engaging the
                target or attacking personnel with personal weapons within a distance of up to 100 meters (110 yards),
                from proximity hand-to-hand combat to close-quarter target negotiation with usually automatic weapons.
                In the typical close combat scenario, the attackers try a very fast, violent takeover of a vehicle or
                structure controlled by the defenders, who usually have no easy method to withdraw. Because attacking
                and defending personnel, hostages/civilians, and friendly personnel can be closely intermingled,
                close-quarters combat demands a rapid assault and a precise implementation of lethal force. The
                operators need good communications, sufficient tactical and weapons training, and the ability to make
                quick decisions in order to limit friendly casualties and raise the likelihood of operational success.

            <h2 class="course_title">Artillery Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">The Artillery School is part of the Defence Force Training Centre (DFTC) and is the
                centre of excellence for artillery training in the Defence Forces (DF). Established in 1931, the
                Artillery School is staffed by high quality instructors from the Artillery Corps. Our knowledge base has
                been continually expanded through our experience of deployments of artillery both at home and in
                overseas missions, and through an active programme of liaison with other military artillery institutions
                and attendance on foreign courses. The Artillery School conducts career and technical courses in Field
                Artillery and Air Defence, supervises all artillery live firing practices within the State, organises
                and supervises Corps Exercises and Combined Arms Demonstrations and analyses and evaluates developments
                in artillery tactics, techniques and procedures. The Artillery School also researches the latest
                artillery technology with a view to constant development of its Corps function.</p>

            <h2 class="course_title">Survival Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">Survival training is a theoretical and physical practice where participants aim to
                survive in the wilderness with as little means as possible. Survival training is used to teach
                survival skills or as a form of recreational activity in which individuals are generally challenged to
                sustain their basic needs, such as food, water and shelter, in a unpopulated area, with little or only
                natural resources. This could include taking long hikes, lighting fires, setting camps, sailing in
                canoes or rafts, fishing, biking (for example with mountain bikes) and so on. Survival trainings are
                mostly held in forests, mountain ranges and hilly areas, such as the Alps and Scandinavia.

                Different organizations coordinate recreational survival trainings, some of which are for children. They
                are popular as business excursions, team building exercises or as a holiday activity. Survival training
                in a recreational context has the intention to help expand team work or strengthen the bond of a group
                by challenging team members, but can also be practiced alone.</p>

            <h2 class="course_title">Combat Medic Training</h2>
            <p class="course_text">The CMSTP is designed with team-paced instruction. This 16-week program trains the
                68W Combat Medic Specialist in foundational skills necessary to become an effective Combat Medic
                Specialist on the battlefield. The student begins training as an Emergency Medical Technician to include
                Basic Life Support (BLS), emergency medical care and evacuation, minor acute care, inpatient and
                outpatient care, and basic force health protection. The student then receives extensive Field Craft
                training with special emphasis on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) during the “Whiskey Phase” of the
                course. Students are trained in limited primary care, medical care for patients exposed to weapons of
                mass destruction, (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear - CBRN), deployable medical systems,
                aircraft and ground evacuation, and casualty triage and processing. The program culminates with a
                rigorous Field Training Exercise (FTX) using realistic combat scenarios to validate what the students
                have learned through practical, real-world applications.</p>
